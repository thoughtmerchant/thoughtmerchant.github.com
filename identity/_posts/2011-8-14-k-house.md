<p><a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/" target="blank">Alex Hillman</a> is leading a really neat project in Kensington, Philadelphia called <a href="http://house.indyhall.org/" target="blank">K-House</a>. Essentially from what I can understand it is a giant live /work space for creative people. Pretty fucking awesome. A few months removed from my years as a creative in Philadelphia, I can only admire with a giant grin on my face.</p>

Keeping tabs on Philly a terribly obsessive behavior, and Alex was looking for a sweet logo inspired from pop art. I really wanted to bring out some tracing paper, and get down and dirty with type again. Well… I present the fruits of labor:

Looks even better on a texture like wood or glass, especially if painted on:

Or if they wanted to get really bold with the logotype:

Philly hipsters would totally dig that bold application.

Yet my favorite part was not working on the computer. It was working with tracing paper, pencil, and markers. I had to clean up the “K” to make it more readable from a distance. In these drawings the x-height was too small. Creating the letter “S” at an angle, with distortion is tricky as well. Actually ended up bringing it into illustrator, straightening out the letters a bit, then applying some computerized distortion so that it could remain clear on any application.
