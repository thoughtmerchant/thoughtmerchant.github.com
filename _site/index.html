 <h2><a href="/thoughts/2011/11/28/occupy-wall-street.html"> OWS Badge </a></h2>
    <p>The Occupy Wall Street movement is very close to home. Literally, they protest 3 blocks away from where I live in Manhattan. After a conversation with a friend, I started doing some designs for a potential logo or sticker. More of a fun thought experiment more than anything.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/thoughts/owsBadge.jpg' alt='occupy wall street badge' />
<p>Tents have become the signature shape for many of the protests around the world. Not because of choice, but out of necessity. The protesters live in tents. Well the triangle is a simple shape, and also the shape for change (delta). So I started with that as a good starting point.</p>

<p>Next was what font to use. Easy choice - I love Futura. Anytime I get to work with Futura, I jump on the chance. Futura is based off of the circle, which is a lovely complement to the triangle.</p>

<p>To broadcast the existence of an OWS protest campsite, one could imaging hooking up a kite, with little triangles taped to the rope. A very subtle, yet effective statement that change is in the air.</p>

<p>This photoshopped preview does not look that good. The real sticker should be die-cut.</p>

    <p>Old fluorescent sign, old car, and another crooked photo. A photo that contains two of my passions and one really bad habit.</p>

 <h2><a href="/identity/2011/08/14/k-house.html"> K-House Logotype Design </a></h2>
    <p><a href='http://dangerouslyawesome.com/' target='blank'>Alex Hillman</a> is leading a really neat project in Kensington, Philadelphia called <a href='http://house.indyhall.org/' target='blank'>K-House</a>. Essentially from what I can understand it is a giant live /work space for creative people. Pretty fucking awesome. A few months removed from my years as a creative in Philadelphia, I can only admire with a giant grin on my face.</p>
<p>Keeping tabs on Philly a terribly obsessive behavior, and Alex was looking for a sweet logo inspired from pop art. I really wanted to bring out some tracing paper, and get down and dirty with type again. Well… I present the fruits of labor:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house-logo.jpg' alt='k-house logo' />
<p>Looks even better on a texture like wood or glass, especially if painted on:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house-texture.jpg' alt='k-house logo on wood texture' />
<p>Or if they wanted to get really bold with the logotype:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house.jpg' alt='k-house logo on building rendering' />
<p>Philly hipsters would totally dig that bold application.</p>

<p>Yet my favorite part was not working on the computer. It was working with tracing paper, pencil, and markers. I had to clean up the “K” to make it more readable from a distance. In these drawings the x-height was too small. Creating the letter “S” at an angle, with distortion is tricky as well. Actually ended up bringing it into illustrator, straightening out the letters a bit, then applying some computerized distortion so that it could remain clear on any application.</p>
