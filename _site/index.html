    <h4>  </h4>
    <p>Old fluorescent sign, old car, and another crooked photo. A photo that contains two of my passions and one really bad habit.</p>

 <h2><a href="/identity/2011/08/14/k-house.html" class="tk-ff-meta-web-pro"> K-House Logotype Design </a></h2>
    <h4>  </h4>
    <p><a href='http://dangerouslyawesome.com/' target='blank'>Alex Hillman</a> is leading a really neat project in Kensington, Philadelphia called <a href='http://house.indyhall.org/' target='blank'>K-House</a>. Essentially from what I can understand it is a giant live /work space for creative people. Pretty fucking awesome. A few months removed from my years as a creative in Philadelphia, I can only admire with a giant grin on my face.</p>
<p>Keeping tabs on Philly a terribly obsessive behavior, and Alex was looking for a sweet logo inspired from pop art. I really wanted to bring out some tracing paper, and get down and dirty with type again. Well… I present the fruits of labor:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house-logo.jpg' alt='k-house logo' />
<p>Looks even better on a texture like wood or glass, especially if painted on:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house-texture.jpg' alt='k-house logo on wood texture' />
<p>Or if they wanted to get really bold with the logotype:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/k-house.jpg' alt='k-house logo on building rendering' />
<p>Philly hipsters would totally dig that bold application.</p>

<p>Yet my favorite part was not working on the computer. It was working with tracing paper, pencil, and markers. I had to clean up the “K” to make it more readable from a distance. In these drawings the x-height was too small. Creating the letter “S” at an angle, with distortion is tricky as well. Actually ended up bringing it into illustrator, straightening out the letters a bit, then applying some computerized distortion so that it could remain clear on any application.</p>

 <h2><a href="/ux/2011/06/04/goruco.html" class="tk-ff-meta-web-pro"> GORUCO Conference </a></h2>
    <h4>  </h4>
    <h3 id='objective'>Objective</h3>

<p>Create a conference badge which is usable and informative for 250 attendees to New York City&#8217;s premier Ruby conference.</p>

<h3 id='problem'>Problem</h3>

<p>Orienting and informing 250+ programmer nerds in a large venue, in a city like New York City, presents many issues. Many conference lanyards are clumsy, large, and ugly - which all affect their retention. Sponsors also pay big dollars to feature their brand image on many of the materials at the conference. Creating memorable keepsakes which the attendees can take home appeals to sponsors and attendees alike.</p>

<h3 id='solution'>Solution</h3>

<p>A simple conference badge that features the name of the attendee on the front, yet when they swing the badge up to read, has the entire program contained inside.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/entire-package.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/handing.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge ' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/booklet-open.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge open' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/booklet-angle.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge at different angle' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/up-close.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge up close' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/flipping.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge' /><img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/reading.jpg' alt='GORUCO Boat tickets' />
<p>The badge in use as Jesse from Blue Box Group talks at the conference.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/jesse.jpg' alt='Jesse wearing GORUCO badge' />
<p>A simple little diagram that was created to give to the printers who were printing the badge. A badge that has the front cover upside down can be problematic. This diagram was sent to the production house to ensure that the print job was completed successfully.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/diagram.jpg' alt='GORUCO badge wearing diagram' />
<p>The details really matter - so we decided to have different colored lanyards for each of the different roles at the conference. Made it very easy to identify who was organizing the conference, who was speaking, and who was attending.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/goruco/lanyards.jpg' alt='Different lanyards for different roles' />
<p>There was a party after the conference on a boat that went around the island of Manhattan. The event was sold out and we needed a way to control who was getting into the party. Simple tickets did the trick.</p>

 <h2><a href="/talks/2011/05/09/rails-for-uxers.html" class="tk-ff-meta-web-pro"> Rails for UXers </a></h2>
    <h4>  </h4>
    <img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/content/talks/rails-for-ux.jpg' alt='Rails for user experience people' /><p>Interested in learning more about the agile rails work environment so that you can integrate more tightly? Well attend my talk at <a href='Pivotal Labs' target='blank'>Pivotal Labs</a> NYC on May 19th! You can find more details on the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Experience-Design/events/17281649/' target='blank'>Agile UX meet-up group</a>.</p>
<p>We are going to go over basic concepts and practices of integrating yourself (an agile UXer) into an agile rails development team. Market research and traditional user experience design are, by practice, waterfall methods. Ruby on rails development environments are almost all agile and finding ways to seamlessly contribute to the team can be difficult.</p>

<p>We will start by going over the basic concepts of Ruby on Rails, and highlight some best practices to integrate tightly either as a consultant or in-house talent. Handing off PSDs and going back to Photoshop are no longer good enough to produce the best digital experiences.</p>
