<h3 id='objective'>Objective</h3>

<p>Creating a dead simple sign-up and system for having one phone number ring multiple phones.</p>

<h3 id='problem'>Problem</h3>

<p>Phone systems are notoriously archaic, and clumsy. Recent services on the web have revitalized the way you can integrate and interact with telephone service. The technology focused solutions neglected the user and it still is very difficult to have one phone number ring other phones simultaneously.</p>

<p>Mashion consulting was trying to purchase a service that had one phone number ring all of their cell phones at once. They were frustrated with the complex and often expensive solutions that were available for such a simple problem.</p>

<p>Pricing was also a concern since many telephone services have hidden charges, unorthodox rates, and complex methods for signing up.</p>

<h3 id='solution'>Solution</h3>

<p>Mashion consulting partnered with Thought Merchants to create the simplest possible solution for the user. They were not only the developers, but first customers to a service they now sell publicly.</p>

<p>The first step was creating a simple and clear sign-up for the user. We accomplished this in the simplest way possible, a one page sign-up with progress disclosure as to not overwhelm the user. One input field greets the user, with a clear left hand side scan line and supporting text to give the user context:</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/callme/signup.jpg' alt='Call Me sign-up page' />
<p>After selecting the zip code you want your phone number to originate from, the system presents you with a drop-down of available phone numbers you can claim.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/callme/signup2.jpg' alt='select a phone number' />
<p>Once entering the phone numbers you want the primary number to call, Call Me prompts you to enter a email address to have your voicemail sent to.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/callme/signup3.jpg' alt='enter an email address for voicemail' />
<p>Final set is creating a password.</p>
<img class='scale-with-grid' src='/images/ux/callme/signup4.jpg' alt='create password' />
<p>Then Call Me sends you off to Amazon Payments to complete the entire process.</p></div>
