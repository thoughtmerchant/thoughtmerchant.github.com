###Objective
Create a more compelling, usable online experience for classical music practitioners to track their practice time.

###Problem
Classical musicians are few and far between these days. They do exist, but often practice long hours alone, or with only a few others. Classical musicians are such a niche that few products or service cater towards their needs.

###Solution
Compound Time was created to help musicians practice the craft they love in a social, positive manner.
