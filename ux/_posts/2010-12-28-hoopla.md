###Objective
Create an application to encourage a successful and competitive sales environment.


###Problem
Sales people at many of the largest companies use SalesForce to  manage their engagements through the sales pipeline. The biggest issue is that most only update their leads when they absolutely have to. Creating a motivational device and rewards for encouraging updating their sales pipeline in the SalesForce application creates a competitive environment that helps businesses close more deals.


###Solution

By creating an ESPN like scoreboard and gaming metrics on a large flatscreen TV in the hallways and offices of sales teams increases the productivity of the sales team.

Thought Merchants ended up creating the screen designs, marketing web site, and conference booth.
