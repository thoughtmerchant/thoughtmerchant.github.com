<p>Interested in learning more about the agile rails work environment so that you can integrate more tightly? Well attend my talk at <a href="Pivotal Labs" target="blank">Pivotal Labs</a> NYC on May 19th! You can find more details on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Experience-Design/events/17281649/" target="blank">Agile UX meet-up group</a>.</p>

We are going to go over basic concepts and practices of integrating yourself (an agile UXer) into an agile rails development team. Market research and traditional user experience design are, by practice, waterfall methods. Ruby on rails development environments are almost all agile and finding ways to seamlessly contribute to the team can be difficult.

We will start by going over the basic concepts of Ruby on Rails, and highlight some best practices to integrate tightly either as a consultant or in-house talent. Handing off PSDs and going back to Photoshop are no longer good enough to produce the best digital experiences.
