<p>On January 25, 2012 I contributed to a talk with a few other colleagues about live style guides in rails applications. <a href="http://casecommons.org/" target="blank">Case Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.pivotallabs.com" target="blank">Pivotal Labs</a> members showed off their live style guide they created for Casebook. I showed off the live style guide we created for <a href="http://efficiency20.com/" target="blank">Efficiency 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>The talk was held at Pivotal Labs NYC. Their offices are just south of Union Square. Below is the snippet from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Experience-Design/events/47644772/" target="blank">Meet-up event description</a>:</p>

> One of the many emergent Agile UX tools enabling teams to more effectively design while building is the Live Style Guide.
>
> It's a great example of applying Agile thinking to UX practice. Here, instead of documenting UI patterns in a traditional static document, the style guide is built using the actual production technology, making it a living and continuously evolving bridge between design and development.
>
> During this session, members of Case Commons, Pivotal Labs, and Efficiency 2.0 will demo implementations of this technique, discuss practical considerations, and compare and contrast their various approaches.  We'll follow their presentation with a panel-style Q&A.
>
> We hope you can join us!
>
> Agenda:
> 6:30 to 7:00pm - Space opens, meet & greet.
> 7:00 to 8:30pm - Presentation, discussion.

####Over 100 people attended the talk!
