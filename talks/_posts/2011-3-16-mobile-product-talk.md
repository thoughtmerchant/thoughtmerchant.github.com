Saturday March 19th at 1:00pm, I will be giving a talk on creating a mobile web experiences for UPennâ€™s Interactive Media Group. The concept of the event is to teach students how to take complex interactive ideas and boil them down to mobile web experiences. Designing desktop web experiences is hard enough, but these days more and more people are creating the mobile experience first. The benefit is you find out what the MVP (minimum viable product) is more quickly, which usually leads to cheaper and faster development.

<p>Sounds like fun! I will be giving out <a href="http://www.paperwireframes.com" target="blank">Paper Wireframes</a> pads for students to use, and helping them work through their mobile web app ideas.</p>
