<h1> About Thought Merchants</h1>
<img src="/images/about/steve-berry.jpg" alt="Steve Berry" class="scale-with-grid"/>

<p>I specialize in creating usable experiences. I have created experiences companies such as Urban Outfitters, QVC, GSI Commerce, and Groupon currently use. I have also consulted for start-ups, and emerging companies like: Efficiency 2.0, Monetate, Hoopla, and FizzLaw.</p>

<p>My experience encompasses creating experiences online, and offline for products and services for both very broad B2C experiences, as well as complex domain specific B2B business applications.</p>

    <h4>Sayings I Live by</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The details ARE the devil.</li>
        <li>If everything is important, then nothing is very important.</li>
        <li>Simple is the language of everyone.</li>
        <li>You are what you make.</li>
        <li>I like good people. They make me smile.</li>
        <li>1-2-3. One primary goal. Two secondary concepts. Three tertiary ideas. Per page – max.</li>
        <li>Solve a problem. Build something that people want. Make it good.</li>
        <li>Successful User Experiences are a by product of friendliness and business process.</li>
        <li>Being wrong is awesome, that’s how you learn.</li>
        <li>Life is complex and nobody is really sure.</li>
        <li>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.</li>
        <li>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.</li>
        <li>Something someone once said is appropriate for this occasion.</li>
        <li>Life is, for most of us, is a continuous process of getting used to things we hadn't expected.</li>
        <li>You simply can't create likable software if you are a dysfunctional company.</li>
        <li>Words that are not collaborative: "we need", "must", "cannot", "don't".</li>
      </ul>
