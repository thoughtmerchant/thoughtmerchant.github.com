<h1> About Thought Merchants</h1>
<img src="/images/about/steve-berry.jpg" alt="Steve Berry" class="scale-with-grid"/>

<p>I make stuff, it just happens to take place on the web most of the time. Sometimes I start off creating someone’s brand, other times I create an online experience, or make a web application more usable.</p>
<p>I love being able to help improve business’ processes, and improve what they offer (or their perception). Bottom line is that I want to have fun and make what you have better. You could say I make things “good”. With the right client I can make it great.</p>

<p>Some things I live by:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The details ARE the devil.</li>
    <li>If everything is important, then nothing is very important.</li>
    <li>Simple is the language of everyone.</li>
    <li>You are what you make.</li>
    <li>I like good people. They make me smile.</li>
    <li>IE sucks.</li>
    <li>1-2-3. One primary goal. Two secondary concepts. Three tertiary ideas. Per page – max.</li>
    <li>Solve a problem. Build something that people want. Make it good.</li>
    <li>Successful User Experiences are a by product of friendliness and business process.</li>
    <li>Being wrong is awesome, that’s how you learn.</li>
    <li>Life is complex and nobody is really sure.</li>
    <li>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few.</li>
    <li>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.</li>
    <li>Something someone once said is appropriate for this occasion.</li>
  </ul>
