The Occupy Wall Street movement is very close to home. Literally, they protest 3 blocks away from where I live in Manhattan. After a conversation with a friend, I started doing some designs for a potential logo or sticker. More of a fun thought experiment more than anything.

Tents have become the signature shape for many of the protests around the world. Not because of choice, but out of necessity. The protesters live in tents. Well the triangle is a simple shape, and also the shape for change (delta). So I started with that as a good starting point.

Next was what font to use. Easy choice - I love Futura. Anytime I get to work with Futura, I jump on the chance. Futura is based off of the circle, which is a lovely complement to the triangle.

To broadcast the existence of an OWS protest campsite, one could imaging hooking up a kite, with little triangles taped to the rope. A very subtle, yet effective statement that change is in the air.

####Sticker Concept
This photoshopped preview does not look that good. The real sticker should be die-cut.
