<p>A Pennsylvania Dutch delicacy! Took a series of photos for Erica at the office here for <a href="http://visitpa.com/" target="blank">Visit PA</a>. You can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thoughtmerchants/sets/72157625305865566/" target="blank">view the full set on Flickr</a>, where I did not touch any of them with Photoshop.</p>

The photo above received a healthy dose of sharpen and some serious temperature adjustments. Looking at them closeup at 100% of the camera’s resolution is pretty interesting… That spongy cake material with the gooey white cream in the middle looks almost sexual. Gotta work on reducing the noise a bit, but otherwise the details are fantastic. Who knew these funny little cakes looked so weird?
