<p><a href="http://www.pivotallabs.com" target="blank">Pivotal Labs</a> and Thought Merchants have partnered again to produce an application to redefine how you watch a movie on your tablet. While I am light on details, this new project is attempting to redefine the way users watch and own movies in their own homes.</p>

This mock-up is of a user viewing all the movies they currently own, and shared movies.

Once a user selects a movie, they are presented with options to share or watch that available movie.
