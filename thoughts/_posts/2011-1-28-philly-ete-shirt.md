<p>The good folks at <a href="http://phillyemergingtech.com/" target="blank">Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise</a> approached me to design their conference t-shirt. Their shirt designs in years past have been functional but not nearly as memorable. Our goal is to create something the attendees will keep and wear outside the one day event.</p>

After several iterations we ended up focusing on a silhouette of Ben Franklin - one of Philadelphia's heroes. The final touch were the glasses resting on Ben's nose. Interestingly enough in my image research, none of his historical portraits display his iconic glasses. I assume that since most paintings of the day were considered "formal", wearing glasses is something you just simply do not do.
