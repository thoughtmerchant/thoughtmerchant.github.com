<p><a href="http://callmehq.com/" target="blank">Call Me</a> is a service the guys at <a href="http://mashion.net" target="blank">Mashion</a> are working on for having one phone number call several other phone numbers simultaneously. There was some interesting and beautiful design that came out of the visual exploration.</p>

My favorite is this concept that was left on the cutting room floor. A beautiful swash typeface, knockouted out of an off-black circle, with some Freight Text Light nicely aligned. Was trying to make the knockout 5 a logotype, but it never really wanted to play nice with all the features and such we were offering.
