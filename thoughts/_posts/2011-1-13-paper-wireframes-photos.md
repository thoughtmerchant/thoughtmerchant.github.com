Entered Paper Wireframes logo into the <a href="http://www.aigapda.com/" target="blank">AIGA Philadelphia Design Awards</a>. Ended up taking some new photos of the pads. Ended up looking really nice. Here is the entry description:

> Paper Wireframes is a rapid iPhone prototyping tool used for mobile application development.
>
> The development for mobile applications is shifting towards total digital ideation, conception, and production. Paper Wireframes is built as a tool to bring the designers and developers back to the physical world in a form factor of an iPhone. The smallest unit of interaction on touch screen mobile devices are human fingers – a trait often overlooked when creating complex mobile applications.
>
> Paper Wireframe’s logo is designed to be a timeless, iconic, and versatile mark that mimics the very icons which are so often the critical elements of mobile interaction.

Again special thanks to Stefan Natchev for his ideation and concept design support. Let’s hope we win something!
