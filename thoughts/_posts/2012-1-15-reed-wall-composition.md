It has been quite some time since I have posted some really original art on my blog. I made this for Shannon Reed's apartment, and it is quite amazing.

This artwork comprises of over 30 different layers of photography and illustration. It is printed at 28 inches by 28 inches on satin paper. The piece is composed of vector line art, photos of abstract landscapes, wood textures, ink in water photographs, then reflected on itself.
