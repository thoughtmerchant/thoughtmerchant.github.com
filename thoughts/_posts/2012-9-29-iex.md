[Thought Merchants](http://thoughtmerchants.com/) and
<a href ="http://www.pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>
 are teaming up with IEX to improve their business processes to make their business more reliable, sustainable, and maintainable. The first step in producing any sort of software product is sharing domain specific knowledge. We were able to bring together leaders from each of IEX's departments to get our project started. Here are a few photos from our project kick-off meeting.
