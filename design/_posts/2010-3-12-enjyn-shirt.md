Congrats to ENJYN. Together we partnered together and created this awesome new t-shirt for them. Nothing feels better than when you make something physical for a client, and everyone gets all excited.

Thought Merchants is responsible for the branding, art direction for the illustration (which was done by PIXOco), hooking ENJYN guys up with Stuart from Vacord who ended up printing these shirts on American Apparel. Excellent!
