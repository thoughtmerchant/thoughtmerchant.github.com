The [Visualized Conference](http://visualized.com/)  had a great after-party where they had large blank boards, encouraging designers to collaborate during the party. Well I could not help myself. There were lots of really interesting looking people at the event, so a few of us started drawing portraits of the gallery patrons on tiny Post-It Notes.
