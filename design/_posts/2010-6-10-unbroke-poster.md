For no apparent reason, I give you “Unbroke”. A certain Titling Gothic Condensed Black caught my eye at the Font Shop – and I just had to make something with it. The logotype seems unfinished yet, but still works at a certain level. Not quite sure why.

The illustration front and center is just a mash up of wood and ink textures that I found or bought online. Ended up with some sweet colors!
